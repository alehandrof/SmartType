SmartType
=========

This package provides smart typography as you type. It’s very much a work in progress. Development began with (and generally follows) what @pedrober’s requests at: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=8069

### Features supported:

- **Smart Quotes**. Just use the regular dumb quotes and (hopefully) they will be converted to the appropriate quotation mark as you type.
- **Auto insert**.
	- a space followed by two hyphens will be converted to an *en dash*
	- three consecutives hyphens will be converted to an *em dash*
	- three consecutives dots will be converted to an *ellipsis*

### TODO

* Turn on and off via setting.
