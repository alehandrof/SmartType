SmartType
=========

This package provides smart typography as you type. Itâ€™s very much a work in progress. Development began with and currently follows what @pedrober requests at: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=8069

### Features supported:

* Smart **quotes**. Just use the regular dumb quotes and (hopefully) they will be converted to the appropriate quote.
* Very, very tentative support for **dashes**:
	- space & two hyphens for en dash
	- three hyphens for em dash
